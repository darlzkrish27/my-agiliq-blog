Using EC2, you can bring up any number of machines online at minutes notice, and after you are done with them, bring them down. How does EC2 work? A EC2 machine is nothing but a bare machine. An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a machine bundled as an Image, with preconfigured software which you can start at moments notice. We will take a AMI with a basic Ubuntu installed, and install Django with Mysql and Apache there. The prerequisites You need to have an AWS account with EC2 enabled. We don’t like to use not standard tools from the shell, right? So we will install ElasticFox, a Firefox plugin to enable using AWS services from within Firefox. Give ElasticFox your EC2 credentials.

Navigate to the public url of your instance and you should see your site. Play around with it. Hmm, we want to test how well does our site perform. We are going to use the awesome benchmarking tool called ab. ab is Apache Benchmark tool, it comes installed with Apache Httpd server. However to benchmark we need to bring up another instance, as running the server and benchmarking tool on same server gives wrong result. Ok so we bring up another server, login and run the ab tool.

    <h2 id="what-is-ec2">What is EC2</h2>

<p>Unless you have been living on Mars these last few years, you are sure to have heard of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">EC2</a>. Amazon’s cloud offering,
it offers infinite scalability. Using EC2, you can bring up any number of machines online at minutes notice, and after
you are done with them, bring them down.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-ec2-work">How does EC2 work?</h2>

<p>A EC2 machine is nothing but a bare machine. An <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">Amazon Machine Image</a> (AMI) is a machine bundled as an Image, with preconfigured software which you can 
start at moments notice. We will take a AMI with a basic Ubuntu installed, and install Django with Mysql and Apache there.</p>

<h2 id="the-prerequisites">The prerequisites</h2>
<p>You need to have an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS account</a> with EC2 enabled. We don’t like to use not standard tools from the shell, right? So we will install
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/elasticfox/">ElasticFox</a>, a Firefox plugin to enable using AWS services from within Firefox.</p>

<p>Give ElasticFox your EC2 credentials.  Launch ElasticFox and lunch an AMI. This is covered in extreme detail in <a href="http://ec2-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/elasticfox-owners-manual.pdf">ElasticFox owners manual</a>
so we will not cover that here.</p>

<p>I started the AMI with AMI id ami-f27c999b. This is a 64 bit Ubuntu Gutsy AMI.</p>

<p>After you start your ami, right click in ElasticFox on your instance and get its Public DNS. This will allow you to ssh to the instance. But you don’t have the root password for it, eh? When you launched your AMI, you used a keypair, right? So you can ssh to your server using your private key.</p>

<p>My public dns was ec2-75-101-203-97.compute-1.amazonaws.com, my private key is stored in a file called id-django. So i login as,</p>

<p>Fine, we are in our brand new EC2 server now! Ok, we do not want to work as root, create a new user and give sudo rights to it.</p>

<p>150+ requests per second. (This page does about 10 database queries). Not bad for an unoptimized server with even DEBUG = True, eh?</p>

<p>We still have a lot to do to make this server production ready. If you bring down this instance, all you data is lost.
So you need to get an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/">EBS</a> volume and attach it to your instance. You also want to backup your data on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s2/">S2</a>. But more about those
