    <p>This is next in the series of apps I am building using various mobile technologies.
It is the same app as build using Java for Android for calculating the Tax payable (in India). You can 
get the code for <a href="https://github.com/agiliq/TaxCalculatorIndia">Objective-C</a>, <a href="https://github.com/agiliq/TaxCalculatorAndroid">Java-Android</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/agiliq/TaxCalculatorPhoneGap">PhoneGap</a>.</p>

<h2 id="first-the-impressions">First the impressions</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.phonegap.com/">Phonegap</a> was the easiest to work with among the Objective-C, Java and PhoneGap, by far.
I created the app as easily as</p>

<p>Step 1. Write the app and test it in Browser using the Chrome developer tools. 
Step 2. Start a project in Xcode.
Step 3. Copy the HTML and CSS files to project directory and export to simulator.</p>

<p>The experience was very good, (After spending time with Obj-C and Java), as I could use a Chrome console as a repl,
something which I sorely missed.</p>

<p>The exported app does <em>look</em> native, with controls which look coming from browser. But with some CSS you can go
a long way here.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Get the Xcode and the Iphone SDK.</li>
  <li>Download PhoneGap and install from PhoneGap iOS, this will create a new user template for PhoneGap in Xcode.</li>
  <li>Create a PhoneGap project in Xcode.</li>
  <li>Edit the www/index.html</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="code-like-it-is-the-web">Code like it is the web</h2>
<p>I don’t like working with the code-&gt;compile-&gt;check in simulator cycle. You can work much faster if you work with the browser.</p>

<p>I edited the index.html, adding the Jquery library for easy DOM manipulation, and a bit of CSS to align.</p>

<h2 id="lay-out-the-layout">Lay out the Layout</h2>

<p>You can layout your UI using the common HTML elements. Here is a snippet from the finished app.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> &lt;div class="input"&gt;
 	&lt;label&gt;
 		Your investments under 80D are:
 	&lt;/label&gt;
 	&lt;input type="number"  placeholder=0 id="infra_investment"&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


 &lt;div class="input"&gt;
 	&lt;label&gt;
 		Your housing loan interests paid are:
 	&lt;/label&gt;
 	&lt;input type="number"  placeholder=0 id="housing_interest"&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These are standard HTML5 elements. Note that we were able to use HTML5 only elements like</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>type="number"  placeholder=0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which set the keyboard type and placeholder which you can do via <code class="highlighter-rouge">android:inputType</code> or editing in Interface Builder.</p>

<h2 id="code-the-code">Code the code</h2>
<p>We will write the code to get the input values and then calculate the tax. We are using Jquery functions
for UI manipulation. Here is what the code looks like.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>		$("#calculate_tax").click(function(){
        income = $("#income").val();
    	investment = $("#investment").val();
		infra_investment = $("#infra_investment").val();
		housing_interest = $("#housing_interest").val();
		medical_premium =  $("#medical_premium").val();
		console.log(""+income+investment+infra_investment+housing_interest+medical_premium);
		if (!income){
			income = 0;
		}
		.....
			var tax = calculateTax(income, investment, infra_investment, housing_interest, medical_premium);
			console.log(""+tax);			
			calculated_tax  = $("#calculated_tax");
			calculated_tax.html(tax);
        });

		function getTax(taxableIncome){
		.....
</code></pre></div></div>
