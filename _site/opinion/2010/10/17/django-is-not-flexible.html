<hr />

<p>One of the most lingering criticisms of Django has been
that it is not flexible. People have criticised its design
as too-tightly coupled, hard to extend, and inflexible.
As a result, people have recommended to roll their own
using SQLchemy, Jinja or web.py.</p>

<p>I think this view is unfounded and wrong. You would be hard
pressed to get the choices and flexibility which Django offers.
Eg, while development I run with Sqlite, Dummy caching, and emails
on console, while on production I switch to PostgreSQL, Memcache, and
queued emails.</p>

<p>Many apps use this backend pattern themselves.
<a href="http://docs.b-list.org/django-registration/0.8/backend-api.html">Django registeration</a>,
<a href="http://ask.github.com/celery/getting-started/first-steps-with-django.html">Django-celery</a>
and our own <a href="http://github.com/agiliq/merchant">merchant</a>.</p>

<p>I have always been annoyed at Django is inflexible meme, and the recent 
<a href="http://charlesleifer.com/blog/django-patterns-pluggable-backends/">Charles Leifer’s post</a>
put various Django plug points to make writing this too post easy to not do it.</p>
