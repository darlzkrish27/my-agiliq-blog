    <p>Django abstracts most of the actions you would be doing with the Database.
What it doesn’t abstracts, and doesn’t try to abstract is the Database modelling part. This is a quick tutorial
describing to how model your data in Django models.py, and how to access and modify them.</p>

<p>Consider a hypothetical HR department, which wants you to build an application to track and manage their processes.
They have employees who work for a department, contractors who work for multiple department. Let’s see how you
you would do that in Django.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>from django.db import models

class Employee(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length = 100)
    department = models.ForeignKey("Department")
    
class Department(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length = 100)
    
class EmployeeHistory(models.Model):
    employee = models.OneToOneField(Employee)
    date_joined = models.DateField()
    marital_status = models.BooleanField()
    
class Contactor(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length = 100)
    departments = models.ManyToManyField(Department)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s see the type of relationship we created here.</p>

<p>An <code class="highlighter-rouge">Employee</code> has a Many-to-one relationship with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Department</code>, (i.e. One department will have many
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Employee</code>, but one employee will have a single departments.)</p>

<p>So <code class="highlighter-rouge">Employee</code> has a field <code class="highlighter-rouge">department = models.ForeignKey("Department")</code>. See that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ForeignKey</code> field
was added on the class which has in <em>many</em>. In database, this creates a FK from in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Employee</code> table which refernces
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Departments</code>.</p>

<p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">Contractor</code> has many-to-many relationships with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Department</code>, so it has a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ManyToMany</code> field. This field can be created
on either classes. At a database level this creates a new table which has a FK to both the tables.</p>

<p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">Employee</code> has one-to-one relationship with <code class="highlighter-rouge">EmployeeHistory</code>. The thing to note here is that whatever we could do with
OneToOneField, we can do by including the fields in the Other Class directly. However when there are fields which are only rarely
needed with a given model, it is useful to separate them via a one-to-one field. The one to one field can be on either class.</p>

<h4 id="accessing-objects">Accessing objects.</h4>

<h5 id="getting-a-specific-employee">Getting a specific employee.</h5>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Employee.objects.get(pk = someval)
Employee.objects.get(name= someval)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h5 id="given-an-department-get-all-employees">Given an department get all employees.</h5>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>department.employee_set.all()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">department</code> gets an attribute name <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;FKClass&gt;_set</code>.</p>

<p>Given an employee, get all colleagues.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>employee.department.employee_set.objects.all()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get siblings, get parents, and get all children.</p>

<p>Given an department, get number of employees.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>department.employee_set.all().count()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ok so the HR department bosses are happy with what they see, and ask you to track this data,
who is the manager of each employee, who is the HOD of each department and when did each employee took leave.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>from django.db import models

class Employee(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length = 100)
    manager = models.ForeignKey("self", blank = True, null = True)
    department = models.ForeignKey("Department")
    
class Department(models.Model):
    hod = models.ForeignKey("Employee")
    name = models.CharField(max_length = 100)
    
class EmployeeHistory(models.Model):
    employee = models.OneToOneField(Employee)
    date_joined = models.DateField()
    marital_status = models.BooleanField()
    
class Contactors(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length = 100)
    departments = models.ManyToManyField(Department)
    

class EmployeeLeave(models.Model):
    leave_taken = models.DateField()
    employee = models.ForeignKey(Employee)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So we now have new fields <code class="highlighter-rouge">hod = models.OneToOneField("Employee")</code> in department and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">manager = models.ForeignKey("self", blank = True, null = True)</code> and a new model <code class="highlighter-rouge">EmployeeLeave</code>. Let su see
the new realtions,</p>

<p>As one <code class="highlighter-rouge">Department</code> will have one <code class="highlighter-rouge">Employee</code> as hod, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Employee</code> can head at max one <code class="highlighter-rouge">Department</code>, we have a one to one relationship<br />
As many <code class="highlighter-rouge">Employee</code> will report to another <code class="highlighter-rouge">Employee</code>, so we have a FK on <code class="highlighter-rouge">Employee</code>, referencing <code class="highlighter-rouge">self</code>.
As <code class="highlighter-rouge">Employee</code> will take many <code class="highlighter-rouge">EmployeeLeave</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">EmployeeLeave</code> has a FK to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Epployee</code></p>

<p>Let us see some queries.</p>

<p>Get all leaves taken by an employee this year</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import datetime
today = datetime.date.today()
start_of_year = datetime.datetime(today.year, 1, 1)
leaves_taken = employee.employeeleave_set.filter(leave_taken__gt=start_of_year, leave_taken__lt = today)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Get a list of all HODs.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#As there are going to be as many Employees as departments
departments = Department.objects.all()
employees = [department.hod for department in departments]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Get a list of all departments a contractor works for.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>contractor.department_set.all()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Get a list of all contractor who work for a department.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>department.contractor_set.all()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that each side of a many to many relationship get a Manager.</p>

<p>List of all managers in a given department.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Todo#(Can't think of any one query way to do this. If you know, let me know :) )
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>List of all leaves taken in a given department.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>EmployeeLeave.objects.filter(employee__department = department)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>None that we used double underscores <code class="highlighter-rouge">__</code> to do a filtering on a field across Entities.</p>

<p>List of all employees which joined a given department this year.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Employee.objects.filter(department = department, employment_history__date_joined__gte=start_of_year, )
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that we used a double underscore <code class="highlighter-rouge">__</code> twice, first to go across entities, and then to define the type of filter(<code class="highlighter-rouge">__gte</code>).
Also we specified two filter conditions, so they were <code class="highlighter-rouge">ANDed</code> together.</p>

<p>List all employees which either report too a given employee, or joined before him.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Employee.objects.filter(Q(manager = employee)|Q(employee_history__date_joined__lt = employee.employee_history.date_joined))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note the new construct <code class="highlighter-rouge">Q</code>, they are used to specify complex boolean operations. Here we used the <code class="highlighter-rouge">|</code> (or operator) to specify or condition.</p>
