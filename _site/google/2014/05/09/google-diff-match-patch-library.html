    <p>Diff match patch library is useful to compare the differences between the two texts.It compares the texts and displays what is added, removed or unchanged.</p>

<p>We use <code class="highlighter-rouge">Python</code> in our example below.</p>

<h4 id="let-us-see-a-quick-example">Let us see a quick example</h4>

<p>Firstly, we will install diff match patch</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip install diff-match-patch

<p>Moving forward we will import diff_match_patch</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import diff_match_patch
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let us consider using two strings, we will name it as <code class="highlighter-rouge">old_string</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">new_string</code></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import diff_match_patch

I am out of control and at times hard to handle difficult things. But if you can't handle me at my worst,
then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best."""
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we will create an object of <code class="highlighter-rouge">diff_match_patch</code> and call <code class="highlighter-rouge">diff_main(old_string, new_string)</code></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import diff_match_patch    

old_string = """I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes,

new_string = """I'm selfish, impatient and a little secure. I don't make mistakes,
I am out of control and at times hard to handle difficult things. But if you can't handle me at my worst,
then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best."""

diff_obj = diff_match_patch.diff_match_patch()
diffs = diff_obj.diff_main(old_string, new_string)

<h4 id="what-diff_maintext1-text2-does">What <code class="highlighter-rouge">diff_main(text1, text2)</code> does?</h4>

<p>It computes an array of differences to describe the transformation of text1 into text2.
For Example in the above code <code class="highlighter-rouge">diffs</code> contains an array of tuples.</p>

<p>We will see what this tuple contains, before that let us make this array Human readable.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">diff_match_patch</code> has a method <code class="highlighter-rouge">diff_cleanupSemantic(diffs)</code> which does the job for us.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>diff_obj.diff_cleanupSemantic(diffs)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">diffs</code> contains</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">[(0, "I'm selfish, impatient and a little "),
 (-1, 'in'),
 (0, 'secure. I '),
 (1, "don't "),
 (0, 'make mistakes,\nI am out of control and at times hard to handle'),
 (1, ' difficult things'),
 (0, ". But if you can't handle me at my worst,\nthen you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.")]</code></p>

<p>Now it looks better, let us see what these tuples contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first element specifies if it is an insertion (1), a deletion (-1) or an equality (0).</li>
  <li>The second element specifies the affected text.</li>
</ul>

<p>To convert these array of tuples to HTML.We use <code class="highlighter-rouge">diff_prettyHtml(diffs)</code>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>html = diff_obj.diff_prettyHtml(diffs) 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There you are, we can now see the differences in old and new text.</p>

<p>** <span>I'm selfish, impatient and a little </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">in</del><span>secure. I </span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">don't </ins> <br />
<span>make mistakes,¶<br />I am out of control and at times hard to handle</span><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;"> difficult things</ins><span>. But if you can't
handle me at my worst,¶<br />then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.</span> **</p>

<p>But the above html is not so clear to understand what is added and removed right?</p>

<p>We will write a method to see these changes side by side.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import diff_match_patch
