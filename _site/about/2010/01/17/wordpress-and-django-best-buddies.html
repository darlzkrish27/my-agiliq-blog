Create a better admin. Add ModelAdmin to generally used models. Allows accessing attributes via the Django style names. If you override __getattr__, you can access the attributes via other names. Eg in the current setup you need to do comment.comment_content, comment.comment_author etc, while we would like to do comment.content and comment.author as a shortcut. class WordPressModel(object): def __getattr__(self, v): if v in self.__dict__: return self.__dict__[v] else: new_v = &quot;%s_%s&quot; % (self.__class__.__name__.lower(), v) if new_v in self.__dict__: return self.__dict__[new_v] else: raise AttributeError It is highly debatable whether this is a good idea :), but it is too convenient right now not to test this method out.

    <p>Summary:
How to integrate a non Django database system in your Django code, using Wordpress
as example. <a href="http://github.com/uswaretech/django-wordpress">The completed code is available at github</a> or you can <a href="#screenshots_wp">see some screnshots</a></p>

<hr />

<p>Though there are quite a <a href="http://github.com/montylounge/django-mingus">few good</a> <a href="http://byteflow.su/">Django blog</a> applications, our blog is based on
<a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>. A <a href="http://mitcho.com/code/yarpp/">number</a> <a href="http://diythemes.com/">of</a> <a href="http://www.backtype.com/">plugin’s</a>
make moving to a Django based app a bad decision
for us, and not in the spirit of “best tools for the job”.</p>

<p>We moved the other way, and decided to use <a href="http://github.com/uswaretech/django-wordpress">Django to admin the
Wordpress database</a>. The completed code is available on <a href="http://github.com/uswaretech/django-wordpress">Github</a></p>

<p>It is not too hard, with the the builtin Django commands. Django provides the
<a href="http://www.djangobook.com/en/1.0/chapter16/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">inspectdb</code></a> command which allows you to build your models.py from an existing
non Django database.</p>

<p>Here we will see the steps followed for Wordpress, but it would be about the same for all
systems.</p>

<h5 id="take-a-back-up-of-wordpress">Take a back up of wordpress</h5>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mysqldump -u wordpress_user -p --database wordpress_database &gt; data.sql
</code></pre></div></div>

<h5 id="create-a-new-project-and-set-its-settings-to-use-the-wordpress-database">Create a new project, and set its settings to use the Wordpress database.</h5>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    DATABASE_ENGINE = 'mysql'           # 'postgresql_psycopg2', 'postgresql', 'mysql', 'sqlite3' or 'oracle'.
    DATABASE_NAME = ''             # Or path to database file if using sqlite3.
    DATABASE_USER = ''             # Not used with sqlite3.
    DATABASE_PASSWORD = ''         # Not used with sqlite3.
    DATABASE_HOST = ''             # Set to empty string for localhost. Not used with sqlite3.
    DATABASE_PORT = ''             # Set to empty string for default. Not used with sqlite3.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h5 id="get-the-initial-modelspy">Get the initial models.py</h5>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./manage.py inspectdb &gt; models.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will create all the database tables in a form Django can understand. Here is what this command creates for a
my Wordpress installation with the YARPP plugin. <a href="http://gist.github.com/278962">http://gist.github.com/278962</a></p>

<h5 id="create-a-new-app-and-put-this-modelspy-there">Create a new app and put this models.py there.</h5>

<p>With this done, you can treat the non Django part as a
standalone application. Since Wordpress appends all its table with <code class="highlighter-rouge">wp_</code> prefix,
we name this applications <code class="highlighter-rouge">wp</code> to maintain table name compatibility with Django naming
conventions.</p>

<p>You will notice that all models have the <code class="highlighter-rouge">db_table</code> populated, so we can rename tables, without changes to the database.</p>

<h5 id="differences-between-wordpress-and-django-style-naming">Differences between Wordpress and Django style naming.</h5>

<p>At this point you will notice some differences in how Django names things (in a
best practice sort of way), and how Wordpress does it.</p>

<p>a. Django table and model class name are (generally) singular. eg <code class="highlighter-rouge">class Post(models.Models)</code> leads to table <code class="highlighter-rouge">app_post</code>.
Wordpress tables are (most of them) named plural eg <code class="highlighter-rouge">wp_posts</code>.</p>

<p>b. Django attributes are generally named without the table name part. Eg</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Comment(models.Model):
    author_name = models.TextField()
    content = models.TextField()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Wordpress is explicit here and includes the table prefix with attributes.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mysql&gt; desc wp_comments;
+----------------------+---------------------+------+-----+---------------------+----------------+
| Field                | Type                | Null | Key | Default             | Extra          |
+----------------------+---------------------+------+-----+---------------------+----------------+
| comment_ID           | bigint(20) unsigned | NO   | PRI | NULL                | auto_increment | 
| comment_post_ID      | bigint(20) unsigned | NO   | MUL | 0                   |                | 
| comment_author       | tinytext            | NO   |     | NULL                |                | 
| comment_author_email | varchar(100)        | NO   |     |                     |                | 

.....
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I believe this is due to the way you would generally be using the code. In Django you would do
<code class="highlighter-rouge">comment.author</code> where being explicit doesn’t add any value, while in Wordpress, you would use,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">select comment_author, post_title ... from wp_comment, wp_post ... where join</code>, where being explicit
is useful.</p>

<p>You can decouple the Django and database names by using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">db_table</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">db_column</code> attributes.
We choose to rename the Class names to match Django conventions while we let the column names remain the same.</p>

<h5 id="add-admin-and-other-django-niceties">Add Admin and other Django niceties.</h5>

<p>Wordpress doesn’t (seem to) have foreign key constraints setup correctly, and
uses  <code class="highlighter-rouge">bigint(20) unsigned</code> without foreign key constraints to refer to referred entities.
This means Django creates all ForeignKeys as IntegerFields.</p>

<p>Modify them to use ForeignKey instead. Also add <code class="highlighter-rouge">__unicode__</code>, to your classes.</p>

<p>Add an <code class="highlighter-rouge">admin.py</code> to register all your classes.</p>

<p>And you are done! Now you can access, and work with your Wordpress data inside Django
and Django admin.</p>

<p>There are a few more things which will allow a easier Wordpress setup.</p>

<h5 id="create-template-tags-to-show-the-latest-posts-and-comments">Create template tags to show the latest posts and comments.</h5>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@register.inclusion_tag("wp/recent_posts.html")
def show_posts(num_comments):
    return {"posts": Post.objects.filter(post_type="post", post_status="publish").order_by("-post_date")[:num_comments]}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So you can see that there is nothing Wordpress specific we need too do here.</p>

<h5 id="create-a-better-admin">Create a better admin.</h5>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Add ModelAdmin to generally used models.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h5 id="allows-accessing-attributes-via-the-django-style-names">Allows accessing attributes via the Django style names.</h5>

<p>If you override <code class="highlighter-rouge">__getattr__</code>, you can access
the attributes via other names. Eg in the current setup you need to do <code class="highlighter-rouge">comment.comment_content</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">comment.comment_author</code> etc,
while we would like to do <code class="highlighter-rouge">comment.content</code>  and <code class="highlighter-rouge">comment.author</code> as a shortcut.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class WordPressModel(object):    
    def __getattr__(self, v):
        if v in self.__dict__:
            return self.__dict__[v]
        else:
            new_v = "%s_%s" % (self.__class__.__name__.lower(),  v)
            if new_v in self.__dict__:
                return self.__dict__[new_v]
            else:
                raise AttributeError
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is highly debatable whether this is a good idea :), but it is too convenient right now not to test this method out.</p>
