<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>A completely client side password generator.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-it">What is it</h3>

<p>Its a chrome app to generate unique passwords for each site. Depending upon the domain and a master password a unique password is generated. It doesn’t need any server and everything happens on the client side.</p>

<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>

<p>I want to use a unique password for each website. However, I don’t want to use lastpass/1password as I find their interface confusing and overkill, and I don’t want my password stored on remote servers.</p>

<p>I use a simple passwording scheme. I have one master password. For each site, I append the first two letters of the domain to master password and use that as the site password. This is sub-optimal as its easy to understand this scheme, if say two of my passwords are leaked.</p>

<p>I want to algorithmically generate the password on the client side, with a chrome app.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h3>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>password_1 = SHA256(masterpassword+domain)
password = take_first_8_letters(password_1)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will generate a per domain password with 8 characters of entropy and it depends only on master password and the domain.</p>

<p>In the UI side, it works like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You set your master password in the app.</li>
  <li>You click the Chrome app button to generate a domain specific password. It generates the domain specific password and copies the password to clipboard.</li>
  <li>You use the password to signup. Next time you want to login, you click the app to get the password.</li>
