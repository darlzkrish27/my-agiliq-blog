Django comes with a very <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/aggregation/">comprehensive documentation</a> for this. Here, I have tried to
put this in how-to form.</p>

<p><a href="#howtos">Jump to howtos</a> or <a href="http://github.com/uswaretech/Shiny-New-Django-1.1/tree/master">Get source on Github</a>.</p>

<p>Essentially, aggregations are nothing but a way to perform an operation on group of rows. In databases,
they are represented by operators as <code class="highlighter-rouge">sum</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">avg</code> etc.</p>

<p>To do these operations Django added two new methods to querysets.</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">aggregate</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">annotate</code></li>
</ol>

<p>When you are have a queryset you can do two operations on it,</p>

<ol>
  <li>Operate over the rowset to get a single value from it. (Such as sum of all salaries in the rowset)</li>
  <li>Operate over the rowset to get a value for <em>each row in the rowset</em> via some related table.</li>
</ol>

<p>The thing to notice is that option 1, will create one row from rowset, while option 2 will
not change the number of rows in the rowset. If you are into analogies, you can think that
option 1 is like a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#reduce">reduce</a> and option 2 is like a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#map">map</a>.</p>

<p>In sql terms, aggregate is a operation(SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX), without a group by,
while annotate is a operation with a group by on rowset_table.id. (Unless explicitly overriden).</p>

<p>Ok enough talk, on to some actual work. Here is a fictional models.py representing
a HRMS application. We will use this to see how to use aggreagtion to solve
some common problems.</p>

<h4 id="find-the-total-number-of-employees">Find the total number of employees.</h4>

<p>In sql you might want to do something like,</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">select count(id) from hrms_employee</code></p>

<p>Which becomes,</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Employee.objects.all().aggregate(total=Count('id'))</code></p>

<p>If fact doing a <code class="highlighter-rouge">connection.queries.pop()</code> shows the exact query.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">SELECT COUNT("hrms_employee"."id") AS "total" FROM "hrms_employee"</code></p>

<p>But wait, we have a builtin method already for that, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Employee.objects.all().count()</code>, so lets try something else.</p>

<h4 id="find-the-total-pay-of-employees">Find the total pay of employees.</h4>

<p>The CEO wants to find out what is the total salary expediture, this also converts
the queryset to a single value, so we want to <code class="highlighter-rouge">.aggregate</code> here.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Employee.objects.all().aggregate(total_payment=Sum('pay'))</code></p>

<p>Gives you the total amount you are paying to your employees.</p>

<h4 id="find-the-total-number-of-employees-per-department">Find the total number of employees, per department.</h4>

<p>Here we want a value per row in queryset, so we need to use aggregate here. Also,
there would be one aggregated value per dpeartment, so we need to annotate Department
queryset.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Department.objects.all().annotate(Count('employee'))</code></p>

<p>If you are only interested in name of department and employee count for it, you can do,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Department.objects.values('dept_name').annotate(Count('employee'))</code></p>

<p>The sql is</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT "hrms_department"."dept_name", COUNT("hrms_employee"."id") AS "employee__count" FROM "hrms_department" LEFT OUTER JOIN "hrms_employee" ON ("hrms_department"."id" = "hrms_employee"."department_id") GROUP BY "hrms_department"."dept_name"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="find-the-total-number-of-employees-for-a-specific-department">Find the total number of employees, for a specific department.</h4>

<p>Here you could use either of <code class="highlighter-rouge">.annotate</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">.aggregate</code>,</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Department.objects.filter(dept_name='Sales').values('dept_name').annotate(Count('employee'))
Department.objects.filter(dept_name='Sales').aggregate(Count('employee'))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you see the SQLs, you will see that <code class="highlighter-rouge">.annotate</code> did a <code class="highlighter-rouge">group by</code>, while the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.aggregate</code>
did not, but as there was only one row, <code class="highlighter-rouge">group by</code> had no effect.</p>

<h4 id="find-the-total-number-of-employees-per-department-per-level">Find the total number of employees, per department, per level</h4>

<p>This time, we can not annotate either Department model, or the Level model, as we
need to <code class="highlighter-rouge">group by</code> both department and level. So we will annotate on Employee</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Employee.objects.values('department__dept_name', 'level__level_name').annotate(Count('id'))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This leads to the sql,</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT "hrms_department"."dept_name", "hrms_level"."level_name", COUNT("hrms_employee"."id") AS "id__count" FROM "hrms_employee" INNER JOIN "hrms_department" ON ("hrms_employee"."department_id" = "hrms_department"."id") INNER JOIN "hrms_level" ON ("hrms_employee"."level_id" = "hrms_level"."id") GROUP BY "hrms_department"."dept_name", "hrms_level"."level_name
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="which-combination-of-employee-and-deparments-employes-the-most-people">Which combination of Employee and Deparments employes the most people</h4>

<p>We can order on the annotated fields, so the last query is modified to,</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Employee.objects.values('department__dept_name', 'level__level_name').annotate(employee_count = Count('id')).order_by('-employee_count')[:1]
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="which-employee-name-is-the-most-common">Which employee name is the most common.</h4>

<p>We can want to <code class="highlighter-rouge">group by emp_name</code>, so <code class="highlighter-rouge">emp_name</code> is added to values. After that we order on the annotated field
and get the first element, to get the most common name.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Employee.objects.values('emp_name').annotate(name_count=Count('id')).order_by('-name_count')[:1]</code></p>

<hr />
<p>This was a overview of how django annotations work. These remove a whole class of queries for which
you had to use custom sql queries in the past.</p>
