In his essay, Ideas for Startups, Paul Graham argues that ideas are not a critical factor for success of startups. Although I do not believe that ideas are worthless, as many people do, I believe that they are not any where near as important as execution. So to prove my point, I am giving away 5 startup ideas in next five days. All of them describe a problem, its solution, the technology involved, the competition and market size. If you are not a hacker, and want to build any of these things may I suggest Uswaretech." />

<h3 id="title">Title:</h3>

<p>Remotely hosted Analytics solution.</p>

<h3 id="the-problem">The problem:</h3>

<p>For most commercial websites tracking results, about their visitors, about the sites which link to them, about which users convert to sales/leads is a big problem. Google Analytics is the default solution for doing this. In truth Google Analytics is an absolutely marvelous piece of software. Yet there are a few problems with this.</p>

<p>For most webmasters, giving information to Google about their sites is a issue. If you install Google Analytics on your site, what you know about your site, Google know too. Your best performing Adwords keywords, conversion ration and most anything. This is a situation in which many webmasters would not like to be in, but as Google Analytics as the best analytics software, most webmasters choose this.</p>

<h3 id="the-solution">The solution:</h3>

<p>Create a remotely hosted analytics software. Do not think much, just STEAL all the features from analytics. If you want to go beyond Analytics, you may try providing services provided by <a href="http://crazyegg.com/">Crazyegg</a>, but I think that would be a case of <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/06/featuritis_vs_t.html">featuritis</a>. Provide ironclad guarantees in your SLA, that this data will never be provided to any third party.</p>

<h3 id="technologies-involved">Technologies involved:</h3>

<p>A server side technology to collect and make meaning of data. Javascript code to capture the visitors information.</p>

<h3 id="existing-competition">Existing Competition:</h3>

<p>There are a lot of people who are trying to do this. <a href="http://haveamint.com">Mint</a> and <a href="http://getclicky.com">Clicky</a> are doing this. Of them Mint is a self hosted solution which means that the users need to install on their server, which is hassle many people do not want to get through. Clicky is a remotely hosted software but this is not comparable to the level of detail provided by Google Analytics.</p>

<h3 id="market-size">Market Size:</h3>

<p>Google bought Urchin in 2005. The exact terms of Google’s Analytics purchase were not disclosed, but were expected to be in <a href="http://www.seroundtable.com/archives/001729.html">ballpark of 30 Millions</a>.</p>

<h3 id="others">Others:</h3>

<p>The big issue here is gaining webmasters trust, that you would never share their data with any third party.</p>
