Welcome to the first post of 2011!

-   The Eldarion Team has launched \"[Gondor](http://gondor.io/): An
    effortless production django hosting\". Currently, it is in private
    beta and going by the homepage sounds very exciting.
-   [PK
    Shiu](http://www.djangopro.com/2011/01/django-database-migration-tool-south-explained/)
    has graphically explained the workflow of South, the most preferred
    migration tool for django.
-   [Andy McKay](http://www.agmweb.ca/blog/andy/2291/) has written an
    article on how to integrate bleach, an HTML whitelist and sanitizer
    with django. Rather than escaping the user\'s input completely (like
    innocuous formatting tags), it escapes only the risky tags like
    script tags.
-   There is an interesting
    [article](http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/2353-5-things-you-might-not-know-about-jquery/)
    on O\'Reilly Answers on \"5 Things You Might Now Know about
    jQuery\".
-   [Andrew Scott](http://www.aes.id.au/?p=569) has a very thoughtful
    article on his experiences developing an android app coming from a
    Java ME background.
-   [Modernizr](http://www.modernizr.com/) is a javascript library that
    detects the availability of HTML5, CSS3 and other latest
    technologies on browsers.
-   If you use
    [django-piston](https://bitbucket.org/jespern/django-piston) for
    exposing RESTful APIs for your django app, you might also want to
    try out
    [django-tastypie](https://github.com/toastdriven/django-tastypie).
    It\'s got lesser boiler-plate code to write but the documentation
    has details on when to choose tastypie.
-   Always been confused on what the encode and decode methods on string
    and unicode objects do in python? There\'s a question in
    [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/447107/whats-the-difference-between-encode-decode-python-2-x)
    that answers the question.
-   There\'s a very humorous cartoon on [XKCD](http://www.xkcd.com/844/)
    on how to write good code ;-)
-   [Sai
    Kiran](http://agiliq.com/blog/2010/12/book-review-the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design/),
    our designer at Agiliq has written a review for the book \"The
    Principles of Beautiful Web Design\".
