This is a good book for anyone who's just starting out in web design, especially those with a creative slant than a technical one. It  is all about principles of design, layout ideas, color theory, textures, typography. 

### Information Architecture
Importance of information architecture (IA) is explained, like how to take the requirements before starting the design process and how to start the design process. 
Unfortunately most of the clients do not provide enough information for design process.

### Grid system
Very well explained about the importance of grid system. I found some interesting things like **“The Rule of Thirds”**, **“960 Grid System”** , **“Symmetrical Balance”** , **“Placement”** , **“Continuance”** ,**“Isolation“**,**“Contrast”**.
Fixed versus Fluid layouts  helps the beginners to understand about  the browsers, screen resolutions etc…

### Color
Color tools and resources introduced like **Color Scheme Designer 3**, **Adobe Kuler, COLOURlovers**, **Color Stream iPhone App**, **Pictaculous**  makes the designer’s work easy to create color palettes for their awesome designs. I liked “the psychology of color “ and how it affects the perception that your site will convey to the visitor. Meanings of colours and examples are great.

### Typography
Web Font Services, Text Image Replacement, sIFR and Cufón, Text Spacing, Text Alignment, Typeface Distinctions, Serif Fonts, Sans-serif Fonts are worth reading.
**Anatomy of a Letterform** is fantastic.
Several links for free font galleries and commercial font galleries are shared.

Overall this book is worth reading for beginners to understand the principles of beautiful web design.
