I have posted two Tutorials for Using Django with Appengine.

- [For people who do not know Django](http://www.42topics.com/dumps/django/docs.html)
- [For people who already know Django](http://www.42topics.com/dumps/appengine/doc.html)  see [what we build in this tutorial](http://blogango.appspot.com/)

And here a few good links about the topic.

- [James Bennet](http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2008/apr/08/batteries-sold-separately/) tells exactly why Appengine and Django are not so good together.
- [Ian Bicking](http://blog.ianbicking.org/2008/04/09/app-engine-commodity-vs-proprietary/) has an interesting take on how Appengine can change the economics of Python hosting.
- [The guys at Joyent](http://www.joyeur.com/2008/04/08/let-my-people-have-root) reading my mind on why I or you can not deploy any production site on Appengine. (Hint. you mean I can never move away, without writing half my code?)
