-   How DOM events work? Fantastic
    [article](http://jupiterit.com/news/a-crash-course-in-how-dom-events-work)
    by [Jeremy Kahn](http://jupiterjs.com/pages/jeremy-kahn) of
    [JupiterJS](http://jupiterjs.com/).
-   [django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) gets class based views.
    Thanks to everyone who
    [contributed](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/14254). Check
    the
    [doc](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/class-based-views/)
    for more details and the
    [migration](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/generic-views-migration/)
    guide.
-   Search Engine Foo: Use [DuckDuckGo](http://www.duckduckgo.com/) to
    search the [django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) and
    [python](http://www.python.org/) docs from within your browser. Just
    use !django \<search query\> or a !python \<search query\> to search
    the docs. Check a [django example
    search](http://www.duckduckgo.com/?q=!django+class+based+views) and
    [python example
    search](http://www.duckduckgo.com/?q=!python+unittest+assertRaises).
    [DuckDuckGo](http://www.duckduckgo.com/) has a lot of other
    [goodies](http://www.duckduckgo.com/goodies.html) too.
-   [Wilson](http://github.com/chrisdickinson/wilson) is a
    [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) web framework whose goal is to bring
    along the parts of [django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) without
    tightly coupling them.
    [Plate](http://github.com/chrisdickinson/plate) is a javascript
    template library compatible with the
    [django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) templating language. Both
    projects are the brain child of [Chris
    Dickson](http://neversaw.us/).
-   With the
    [inclusion](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/staticfiles/)
    of django-staticfiles in contrib, there\'s been a [good
    debate](http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_thread/thread/27054fb73cb55620)
    on the decision behind adding apps to contrib.
    [Jacob](http://www.jacobian.org/) talks about how he wouldn\'t have
    a contrib if he was to rewrite
    [django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) from scratch and the
    decision behind not including some popular apps like [Django Debug
    Toolbar](http://github.com/robhudson/django-debug-toolbar),
    [South](http://south.aeracode.org/) and
    [django-registration](http://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration/wiki/Home)
    into contrib. Do read and chime in your thoughts.
-   Build cross-device javascript applications for smartphones with the
    [jQuery Mobile Framework](http://jquerymobile.com/).
-   Starting from November 1, Amazon plans to offer a micro EC2 instance
    free for an year for new customers. Check the
    [page](http://aws.amazon.com/free/) for more details.
-   The [results](https://www.survs.com/results/33Q0OZZE/MV653KSPI2) of
    the [Git Survey
    2010](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitSurvey2010) are out.
    Not very different compared to the [last
    year\'s](http://www.survs.com/WO/WebObjects/Survs.woa/wa/shareResults?survey=2PIMZGU0&rndm=678J66QRA2)
    results (from a quick glance).
-   [Continuous integration with django and
    hudson](http://voices.canonical.com/isd/?p=92) is a blog post by
    [Michael Foord](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/). He also has a
    [related](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/arch_d7_2010_10_16.shtml#e1190)
    post on his personal blog.
-   [Merchant](http://github.com/agiliq/merchant), the
    [django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) app that provides a uniform
    API and pluggable interface for various payment processors now has
    \'some\' [docs](http://agiliq.com/docs/merchant). Let us know how we
    can improve the project further.
