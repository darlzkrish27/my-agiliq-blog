It\'s been a while since we posted a link roundup. With holidays
starting soon, we thought of advancing the post.

-   Are you a [full-stack
    programmer](http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=461505383919)?
    Interesting article by Carlos Bueno of Facebook on the various
    interconnections in computing.
-   [Daniel
    Greenfeld](http://pydanny.blogspot.com/2010/12/stupid-template-languages.html)
    wrote a post on why he prefers stupid template languages. His post
    received reactions from Armin Ronacher, author of Jinja2, Mike Bayer
    of Mako and Steve Holden, chairman of the PSF.
-   If you are using Django 1.1, then it is time for you to upgrade to
    the latest minor revision in the series 1.1.3. Check the
    security release post.
-   Django 1.3 beta 1 has been released and we can expect some good news
    soon. Check James Bennett\'s post on the djangoproject site.
-   markitup is a jQuery plugin that converts a textarea into a markup
    editor. It supports a wide variety of markup languages and has a
    neat preview feature. All this under 10Kb.
-   Yann Malet of LincolnLoop has a post on using proxy models in django
    to customize the admin.
-   Disqus has released quite a few interesting projects off late and
    Nexus seems to be very interesting.
-   Skype was down for quite some time today and almost totally cut us
    off. Dan York has an article on understanding the Skype outage.
-   Red Hat has touched an annual revenue of \$1 billion. It has the
    distinction of the first open source company to touch this figure.
    Now if only, they could upgrade the python version on their
    enterprise linux variants ;-)
