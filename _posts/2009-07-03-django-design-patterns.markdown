This is announcement about our new work, [Django design patterns](http://djangodesignpatterns.uswaretech.net/), a ebook about, well, Django design patterns. (Well imagine that!). Here is the readme copied from there.

-------
[Edit] Syntax highlighting and indentation preservation were totally brroken. Fixed now.

-------

Django design patterns is a book about commonly occuring patterns in Django. Not
patterns in Gof sense, but patterns in the sense, we work this way, and it works
for us. For us it is a ~pattern of work~ sense.

At this point this is just a lot of brain dump from us.

The latest sources are always available from
http://github.com/uswaretech/django-design-patterns/tree/master
and latest html from http://djangodesignpatterns.uswaretech.net/

Please leave errata, feedback, critique as comments here.

This is still very much a work in progress, released in the spirit of release early, release often. [Click here](http://djangodesignpatterns.uswaretech.net/) to get it, or [fork it on Github](http://github.com/uswaretech/django-design-patterns/tree/master)
